# Genshin Impact Windsong Lyre scripts
Before running any of these scripts, you'll need to first `pip install pynput`.

I don't know how to work with MIDI files, so after I first draft up an arrangement in [Minecraft Note Block Studio](https://opennbs.org/), I manually input every note into a python script. When I do figure out how to work with MIDI files, I'd like to make a script that can take in a MIDI file as input, and then play the MIDI file.
